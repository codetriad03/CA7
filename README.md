TASK 1:
The data was taken of News and for keeping the data update a task is scheduled in the Windows Task Scheduler to keep running the script for getting the news headlines every 5 minutes for indefinite time.

TASK 2:
In this step, the data was processed and evaluation was done on certain models to select the best fit model. The following steps were implemented:
1. Data Preparation:
   Ensured preprocessed data from DVC is split into training, validation, and testing sets.
2. Model Selection:
   Chose suitable ML algorithms like decision trees, random forests, SVMs, or neural networks.
3. Model Training with MLflow:
   Implemented training scripts using MLflow, logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):
   Optimized model performance with techniques like grid search or random search.
5. Model Evaluation:
   Evaluated models using predefined criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC.
6. Select Best Model:
   Chose the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
7. Model Deployment:
   Deployed the selected model for production, involving packaging, API creation, containerization, or integration.
